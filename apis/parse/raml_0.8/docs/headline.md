Parse offers developers a backend-as-a-service platform for their mobile applications. Developers can use SDKs for both iOS and Android to persist data and more. The REST API lets developers interact with Parse from computers that aren't mobile devices. With the APIs developers can have their webserver show data from Parse on a website, upload large amounts of data that will later be consumed in a mobile app, download recent data to run their own custom analytics and more.
