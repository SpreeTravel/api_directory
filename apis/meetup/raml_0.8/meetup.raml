/batch: 
  type: meetupResource
  post: 
    description: |
      Performs multiple API requests in batch, useful for reducing HTTP network requests. This method is only available for OAuth authentication
      
      #Request Parameters
      You may supply up to 10 API requests in one batch request using the required "requests" parameter. Each of these individual batched requests will be tallied separately the same way they would when making individual requests. The batch request itself will not be tallied. As such, batch requests can not be rate limited. The only failures that you should account for are an authentication failure or a malformed JSON encoding of requests provided with the "requests" parameter.
      
      #Composing batch requests
      Requests should be provided within a JSON-encoded array in the following format attached the requests parameter within a POST body
        
       <pre><code>[{
         "path": "/2/member/self",
         "ref":  "me",
         "params": {
           "only": "name,id"
         }
       }]</code></pre>
      
      Only "path" is required. "path" represents the API path for the method. "ref" provides a way to tag a request in a batch with a label that you can associated with its response in the body of the batch response. This will default to the provided "path". You may also supply a "params" key with a JSON object representing the parameters provided for the request. At this time only HTTP GET requests are supported. In the future we may also support POST and DELETE requests. When that happens you may indicate the HTTP method with the "method" key which may be one of "GET", "POST", or "DELETE". For now you may omit "method" as it will always be "GET" until other HTTP methods are supported.
      
      #Interpreting batch responses
      A response to a batch request will be in the format
      
      <pre><code>[{
         "path": "/2/member/self"
         "status": 200,
         "ref": "me",
         "body": {
           "id": 1234,
           "name": "Noah"
         },
         "headers": {
           "key": "value"
          }
       }]</code></pre>
      
      "path" is the path of the method invoked. "status" represents the HTTP status code returned for the request. "ref" is the name provided for the inbound request. "body" is the JSON-encoded response from the given API request. "headers" is a JSON-encoded object representing the headers returned for that request. These requests may fail the same way they would when making individual requests. The response will indicate these failures.
      
      In order to preserve server resources and return batch responses within a reasonable amount of time, individual requests may will timeout if a response is not computed within a reasonable amount of time. This allows for some requests to fail and others to pass which is a nicer alternative to an all or nothing response timeout. A timed out request can be identified by inspecting its response's "status" field for a value of 504. A timed out response may look like.
      
      <pre><code>[{
         "status" : 504,
         "body" : {
          "errors" : [{"code": "request_timeout", "message":"request timed out"}]
         },
         "headers" : { ... },
         "path" : "/end/point",
         "ref" : "request_ref"
       }]</code></pre>

        There are three ways to use this method. In all cases you should use the 'event_id' parameter:
        1. Use 'since_count' with 'callback' or 'since_mtime' with 'callback'.
        2. Use 'since_count' or 'since_mtime'.
        3. Use 'group_id' or 'member_id' with or without 'order'.
        
        #1
        This long-polling stream can be easily consumed using JavaScript in any modern browser. Checkin notifications are received when they happen, or as soon as your script finishes handling its last notification.
        Checkin notification objects include these properties. This method's response is an array of zero or more of these, while Meetup's JS client calls your callback function with exactly one object.
        #2
        This method serves checkin notifications using chunked encoding to maintian a persistent connection with a client. The connection will only be terminiated for server maintenance or a connection error. It is suitable for low-level HTTP clients rather than web browsers.
        This stream includes the same JSON notification objects as its long-polling counterpart. These are served one per HTTP chunk and terminated by newlines.
        #3
        This method returns checkins for an event. To post checkins, see /2/checkin.
        For private groups, the authenticated user must be a member to see checkins.

        #Request Parameters
        For geo-based requests, you may provide a location in one of three ways. By lat and lon, by zip, or by country, city, and optionally a state, if the provided country has states.
        
        If the server is unable to produce recommendations in a suitable amount of time, a 503 error will be returned. If no parameters are specified, Meetups are recommended for the upcoming week in the member's default location.
        
        Pagination works a little differently in this method than in others. Rather than using "offset" and "page" request parameters, this method uses an opaque "page_token" request parameter to determine the page of results returned. If there are more results, the "next" property of the meta section of the response will contain the next page's page_token. The number of results returned is not deterministic but a best-effort attempt will be made to return at least some.
